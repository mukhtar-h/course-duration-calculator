    <dt>How this works</dt>
    <dd>This is very simple, on the first input field you give the course duration in hours, on the second input field you give the time in hours you can practice.</dd>
    <dt>How the result is shown</dt>
    <dd>On the input given the logic will calculate the course duration in Days, Hours, and Minutes.</dd>
    <dt>Example</dt>
    <dd>Lets assume you have a course of 55.4 hours and you can practice daily for only 2.5 hours. So now the course duration will be 22 Days, 0 Hours, and 0 Minutes.</dd>
